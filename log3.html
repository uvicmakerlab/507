<a name="description" class="anchor" href="#description"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Log 3: Environmental Scan</h3>

<p>This entry in your research log prompts you to start surveying and gathering materials related to your research. For the entry, you should submit the following:<ul>
<li>A small repository of files applicable to your research (these files should correspond with primary sources; no need to worry about secondary sources or related criticism for now);</li>
<li>A spreadsheet containing metadata for your repository; and</li>
<li>A brief (150-300 words) explanation of what archives/collections you surveyed, what you found, and what you didn't find.</li></ul></p>

<p>A few important details:<ul>
<li>Your repo should be contained within and pushed to our English507 repo. I recommend creating a subdirectory (e.g., "sources" or "media") within your dedicated folder (e.g., "sayers") and dumping the content there.</li>
<li>You can push files in XLS, CSV, and the like to GitHub. Just drop your spreadsheet in the subdirectory (e.g., "sources" or "media") referenced above.  </li>
<li>Avoid large files, including video and audio clips beyond a minute in duration or comprising more than 10% of the original.</li>
<li>Your spreadsheet will also act as a metadata model. It should follow the guidelines for the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/" target="_blank">Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1</a>. Consider dedicating columns to elements appropriate for your research. Of course, what constitutes an "appropriate element" depends on the project. However, at a minimum, you'll likely want to use "title," "source," "publisher," "type," "format," "description," "date," and "creator."</li>  
<li>You'll submit this entry twice: once on the 27th and again on the 3rd. While the first draft does not need to be complete, it should give all of us in 507 a concrete sense of what you're researching. The 150-300 words should be submitted on the 27th, and they can be revised (after further research) for the 3rd.</li>
<li>When submitting your revised entry (on the 3rd), you can just edit your 150-300 words, spreadsheet, and repo (e.g., by adding/removing files), and then push the changes/revisions to GitHub. You don't need to submit different files (or the like). After all, Git generates a revision history.</li>
<li>Your sources do <strong>not</strong> need to be digital or online. They can be objects you have on hand, even if you do not ultimately digitize them.</li>
<li>Here are a few domains that might pique your interest: <a href="http://www.canadiana.ca/en/home" target="_blank">Canadiana</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>, <a href="http://dp.la/" target="_blank">Digital Public Library of America</a>, <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org/" target="_blank">Hathi Trust</a>, and <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/" target="_blank">Europeana</a>.</li> 
<li>Either before or as you start producing metadata, I recommend perusing <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/library/featured/collections/index.php" target="_blank">Digital Collections at UVic</a> to see how (among other things) they implement Dublin Core. For instance, see <a href="http://contentdm.library.uvic.ca/cdm/singleitem/collection/collection24/id/177" target="_blank">this item</a> in the A.A. Brown collection, which was developed by Jana Millar Usiskin during English 507 (Spring 2012).</li></ul></p>

<p>As you proceed, please don't hesitate to get in touch with questions or concerns. I imagine there are numerous issues and concerns that I either neglected or did not directly address here.</p>
